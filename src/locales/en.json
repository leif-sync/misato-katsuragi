      "Misato isn’t just NERV’s Chief Operations Officer and the brilliant strategist behind every battle against the Angels—she’s also the beating heart of humanity’s struggle. She’s the adult figure, imperfect yet caring, who takes Shinji, Asuka, and Rei under her wing, guiding them with a mix of firmness, warmth, and very human messiness.",
      "Beyond her authority at the base, Misato charms us with her genuine humanity. She’s the woman who celebrates victories with a beer and a smile, and who navigates the chaos of her own apartment alongside her penguin, Pen-Pen. It’s this rare combination of professional skill and personal vulnerability that makes her such a memorable and relatable character.",
      "Here, we celebrate Misato Katsuragi in all her dimensions: her sharp wit on the battlefield, her iconic style, and the strength she shows despite the scars of her past."
